# LawnMowerSimulator
Final Project for my high school APCS course!

This is one of the better-documented and designed programs I have written, so this is here as evidence of some amount of rigor and commitment in software delivery beyond being purely interest and curiosity-movitated.

Overarching product documentation is included, as well as our presentation.
